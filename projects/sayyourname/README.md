say your name
-------
This is a project that you tell the computer your name, 
and the robot will show your info and record it in the system list.

I would like to show the accurate informaion about you. And I 
wonder, whether the computer would find everything about you in 
the internet at the current time throught your voice. And I also want to konw, whether it is exciting if you would be shown by a certain accurate voice.

What would it be like? It‘s just a joke. You could contact callblueday@gmail.com
